			<h2>1.Mt.Erebus</h2>
			<p>Erebus. It’s a good name for the volcano. In Greek myth, Erebus was the son of the god Chaos, and his mother was Gaia or Earth. Erebus was made of darkness and shadow, and he filled the corners of the world with his darkness.</p>
			<p>The Mt. Erebus volcano features a 1,700-degree Fahrenheit lava lake, a swirling pool of magma that may be many miles deep. While the inside of Mt. Erebus may be extremely hot, outside of it, one would quickly freeze to death in the Antarctic temperatures.</p>
			<p>One of the things that makes Erebus significant - and the reason it is the location of the Mount Erebus Volcano Observatory, or “MEVO” - is that Erebus is one of only a few consistently active volcanos in the world. Rather than lying dormant and then spectacularly erupting once every few hundred years, though it does that on occasion too, Mt. Erebus is always on, bubbling, releasing gas and flinging ten feet wide volcanic bombs .</p>

			<h2>2.McMurdo Dry Valleys</h2>
			<p>In the farthest reaches of the world, where everything is white with blinding snow and ice, the clear McMurdo Dry Valleys are a striking anomaly. Ice and snow-free due to unique conditions, these valleys have intrigued researchers as the landscape on Earth that’s as close to Mars as we can currently get.</p>
			<p>With 98% of its surface being covered in a mile-deep sheet of ice, Antarctica is the epitome of an unforgiving environment. Life is a rare occurrence in this severe climate, which is considered the driest, coldest, and windiest desert on planet Earth - but life has been found, in the most unlikely of places, and that unlikely place is the alien terrain of the McMurdo Dry Valleys.</p>

			<h2>3.Blood Falls</h2>
			<p>This five-story, blood-red waterfall pours very slowly out of the Taylor Glacier in Antarctica’s McMurdo Dry Valleys. The trapped lake has very high salinity and is rich in iron, which gives the waterfall its red color. A fissure in the glacier allows the subglacial lake to flow out, forming the falls without contaminating the ecosystem within.</p>
		</div> 
		<div class="style-content">
			<h2>4.Southern Pole of Inaccessibility</h2>
			<p>The Pole has a year round average temperature of -58.2°C (-72°F).Due to its remoteness - the South Pole is 878 km away and the nearest city, Cape Town in South Africa, is 5631 km distant - the Pole doesn’t see visitors very often. A Soviet expedition led by Yevgeny Tolstikov reached the Pole of Inaccessibility for the first time in 1958. The group left a small research base, also called Pole of Inaccessibility, topped off with a bust of Vladimir Lenin that faces Moscow. The station was in operation from December 14th to 26th, 1958. Since then, at least two more expeditions have reached the Pole. An American expedition arrived in 1965 and in 2007 a British/Canadian expedition became the first to arrive on foot, where they discovered the research station completely covered in snow. Therefore, they were unable to get inside the building to sign the golden visitors’ book that the Soviets had left nearly fifty years before.</p>

			<h2>5.Lake Vostok</h2>
			<p>In 1996, Russian scientists were drilling ice core samples at Vostok Station in Antarctica. the uppermost region of the world’s largest warm-water sub-glacial lake - a lake roughly the size of Lake Ontario. The lake is composed of fresh water and has been isolated beneath the glacier for somewhere between half a million and one million years.</p>
			<p>This lake could possibly be the most pristine liquid environment on Earth and could be full of living creatures and organisms that, due to isolation and adaptation, live nowhere else.</p>
